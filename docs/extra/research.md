# Your Help is Needed: Be Part of the Research!

### Anyone who is interested,

Thank you for your interest in supporting my CSC3101 Capstone Project. As part of my final-year requirements, I am developing **SmartAdmin**, a research prototype that uses generative AI to assist customer service agents in handling delivery modification requests.

To complete the **evaluation section** of my final report, I need real-world data to measure the system's accuracy, safety, and efficiency. Your help would make a significant difference in producing credible, evidence-based results.

### What Participation Involves
I am kindly requesting your voluntary assistance in:

1. **Test the SmartAdmin App** by carrying out a few action requests based on the list of features provided below: 
    - Edit Parcel Pickup/Delivery Remarks
    - Update Parcel Pickup/Delivery Address
    - Mark/Unmark Parcels as urgent delivery
    - Recent Job Analysis
    - Edit Admin User Profile

2. **Provide Feedback on Actions** performed by SmartAdmin whether they were accurate, partially accurate, or inaccurate.  

Participation is **entirely voluntary**, and you may contribute as much or as little as you are comfortable with. Even a small number of examples would be valuable.

### Confidentiality and Data Usage

- All shared data will be **used solely for academic evaluation** in my capstone project.
- The SmartAdmin is running based on staging data (https://stg.uparcel.sg/) and does not interact with live customer data.
- No identifying information about customers, agents, or specific orders will be included in my report.
- Results will be presented in aggregate form (e.g., accuracy metrics across message types).
- Data will be deleted after project completion (April 2026).
- This aligns with ethical guidelines in my project (Section 3.7: Authentication, Security & Ethical Considerations).

### Benefits of Participation
- Opportunity to provide feedback on SmartAdmin (optional demo/testing sessions).
- Acknowledgment in the "Acknowledgments" section of my report (with your permission and preferred name/format).

### Consent Statement
By providing data or assistance, you confirm that:

- I have read and understood the purpose and use of the data.
- My participation is voluntary, and I may withdraw at any time without consequence.
- I confirm that any shared messages are fully anonymized and do not contain personal or sensitive information.
- I agree to the data being used for evaluation in this capstone project.

### How to start?
